## Examples and Demo

## useSpeechSynthesis

A react hook for the browser's [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis). It exposes the options and controls to the underlying SpeechSynthesis in the browser.

### Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useSpeechSynthesis } from 'react-speech-kit';

function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const { speak } = useSpeechSynthesis();

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={value}
        onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => speak({ text: value })}>Speak</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Args

#### onEnd

`function()` _optional_

Called when SpeechSynthesis finishes reading the text or is cancelled. It is called with no argumnents. Very useful for triggering a state change after something has been read.

### Returns

useSpeechSynthesis returns an object which contains the following:

#### speak

`function({ text: string, voice: SpeechSynthesisVoice })`

Call to make the browser read some text. You can change the voice by passing an available SpeechSynthesisVoice (from the voices array). Note that some browsers require a direct user action initiate SpeechSynthesis. To make sure it works, it is recommended that you call speak for the first time in a click event handler.

#### cancel

`function()`

Call to make SpeechSynthesis stop reading.

#### speaking

`boolean`

True when SpeechSynthesis is actively speaking.

#### supported

`boolean`

Will be true if the browser supports SpeechSynthesis. Keep this in mind and use this as a guard before rendering any control that allow a user to call speak.

#### voices

`[SpeechSynthesisVoice]`

An array of available voices which can be passed to the speak function. An example SpeechSynthesisVoice voice has the following properties.

```
{
  default: true
  lang: "en-AU"
  localService: true
  name: "Karen"
  voiceURI: "Karen"
}
```

In some browsers voices load asynchronously. In these cases, the array will be empty until they are available.

## useSpeechRecognition

A react hook for the browser's [SpeechRecognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition).

### Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useSpeechRecognition } from 'react-speech-kit';

function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const { listen, listening, stop } = useSpeechRecognition({
    onResult: (result) => {
      setValue(result);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={value}
        onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button onMouseDown={listen} onMouseUp={stop}>
        ðŸŽ¤
      </button>
      {listening && <div>Go ahead I'm listening</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Args

#### onEnd

`function()`

Called when SpeechRecognition stops listening.

#### onResult

`function(transcript: string, final: string, interim: string)`

Called when SpeechRecognition has a result. It is called with a string containing a transcript of the entire recognized speech, a string containing the final transcript of the most recent recognized speech, and a string containing the interim transcript of current speech.

### Returns

useSpeechRecognition returns an object which contains the following:

#### listen

`function({ interimResults: boolean, lang: string })`

Call to make the browser start listening for input. Every time it processes a result, it will forward a transcript to the provided onResult function. You can modify behavior by passing the following arguments:

- **lang**  
   `string`  
   The language the SpeechRecognition will try to interpret the input in. Use the languageCode from this list of languages that Chrome supports ([here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages)) e.g: "en-AU". If not specified, this defaults to the HTML lang attribute value, or the user agent's language setting if that isn't set either.

- **interimResults**  
   `boolean` _(default: true)_  
   SpeechRecognition can provide realtime results as it's trying to figure out the best match for the input. Set to false if you only want the final result.

- **continuous**  
   `boolean` _(default: false)_  
   The continuous property of the SpeechRecognition interface controls whether continuous results are returned for each recognition, or only a single result.

- **nonStop**  
   `boolean` _(default: true)_  
   When set to `true` SpeechRecognition will not stop automatically after inactivity.

#### stop

`function()`

Call to make SpeechRecognition stop listening. This will call the provided onEnd function as well.

#### listening

`boolean`

True when SpeechRecognition is actively listening.

#### supported

`boolean`

Will be true if the browser supports SpeechRecognition. Keep this in mind and use this as a guard before rendering any control that allow a user to call listen.
