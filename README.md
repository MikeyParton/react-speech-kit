## Install
```bash
yarn add react-speech-kit
```

## Examples and Demo
A full example can be found [here](https://mikeyparton.github.io/react-speech-kit/). The source code is in the [examples directory](https://github.com/MikeyParton/react-speech-kit/tree/master/examples/src).

## useSpeechSynthesis
A react hook for the browser's [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis). It exposes the options and controls to the underlying SpeechSynthesis in the browser.

### Usage
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useSpeechSynthesis } from "react-speech-kit";

function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  const { speak } = useSpeechSynthesis();

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={value}
        onChange={event => setValue(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => speak({ text: value })}>Speak</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Args

#### onEnd
`function()` _optional_

Called when SpeechSynthesis finishes reading the text or is cancelled. It is called with no argumnents. Very useful for triggering a state change after something has been read.

### Returns
useSpeechSynthesis returns an object which contains the following:

#### speak
`function({ text: string, voice: SpeechSynthesisVoice })`

Call to make the browser read some text. You can change the voice by passing an available SpeechSynthesisVoice (from the voices array). Note that some browsers require a direct user action initiate SpeechSynthesis. To make sure it works, it is recommended that you call speak for the first time in a click event handler.

#### cancel
`function()`

Call to make SpeechSynthesis stop reading.

#### speaking
`boolean`

True when SpeechSynthesis is actively speaking.

#### supported
`boolean`

Will be true if the browser supports SpeechSynthesis. Keep this in mind and use this as a guard before rendering any control that allow a user to call speak.

#### voices
`[SpeechSynthesisVoice]`

An array of available voices which can be passed to the speak function. An example SpeechSynthesisVoice voice has the following properties.
```
{
  default: true
  lang: "en-AU"
  localService: true
  name: "Karen"
  voiceURI: "Karen"
}
```
In some browsers voices load asynchronously. In these cases, the array will be empty until they are available.

## useSpeechRecognition
A react hook for the browser's [SpeechRecognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition).

### Usage
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useSpeechRecognition } from "react-speech-kit";

function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  const { listen, listening, stop } = useSpeechRecognition({
    onResult: result => {
      setValue(result);
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={value}
        onChange={event => setValue(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button onMouseDown={listen} onMouseUp={stop}>
        ðŸŽ¤
      </button>
      {listening && <div>Go ahead I'm listening</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Args

#### onEnd
`function()`

Called when SpeechRecognition stops listening.

#### onResult
`function(string)`

Called when SpeechRecognition has a result. It is called with a string containing a transcript of the recognized speech.

### Returns
useSpeechRecognition returns an object which contains the following:

#### listen
`function({ interimResults: boolean, lang: string })`

Call to make the browser start listening for input. Every time it processes a result, it will forward a transcript to the provided onResult function. You can modify behavior by passing the following arguments:

- **lang**  
   `string`  
   The language the SpeechRecognition will try to interpret the input in. Use the languageCode from this list of languages that Chrome supports ([here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages)) e.g: "en-AU". If not specified, this defaults to the HTML lang attribute value, or the user agent's language setting if that isn't set either.

- **interimResults**  
   `boolean` _(default: true)_   
   SpeechRecognition can provide realtime results as it's trying to figure out the best match for the input. Set to false if you only want the final result.

#### stop
`function()`

Call to make SpeechRecognition stop listening. This will call the provided onEnd function as well.

#### listening
`boolean`

True when SpeechRecognition is actively listening.

#### supported
`boolean`

Will be true if the browser supports SpeechRecognition. Keep this in mind and use this as a guard before rendering any control that allow a user to call listen.

## Don't want to use hooks yet?
You can import the `SpeechRecognition` and `SpeechSynthesis` components from version 1 which work exactly the same way but use render props to expose the controls. Examples of implementation are in the in the [examples directory](https://github.com/MikeyParton/react-speech-kit/tree/master/examples/src).
